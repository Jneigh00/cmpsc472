# Processes and Threads

## Interprocess Communication

#### types of system processes
1) independent
2) cooperating
#### types of communication
1) shared (memory, buffer, file, etc.)
2) message passing (only way for distributed systems: CMPSC512)

### Message Passing
- naming scheme
	- send(msg, P1)
	- send(msg, mailbox1)
	- receive(msg, P2)
	- receive(msg, mailbox2)
- synchronization
	- {,non}blocking send
	- {,non}blocking receive
- buffer size


## Threads
### Process
- unit of resource ownership
- unit of dispatch

### Multithreading (OS)
- thread becomes unit of dispatch
- threads execute within process space
	- may or may not interact with other threads

### Per-process Items
- [[PCB]]
	- Virtual address space
	- Global variables
	- Open files
	- Child processes
- Timers
- Signals
- Semaphores
- Acct info

### Per-thread Items
- TCB (thread control block)
	- Program counter
	- Stack
	- Register Set
	- State
	- Local variables
- states
	- ready
	- running
	- blocked

### Single threaded model
```
+-----------------------+
|              |user  | |
| |PCB|        |stack | |
|              |------| |
|              |kernel| |
| | addr |     |stack | |
| |space |              |
+-----------------------+
```

```plantuml
object PCB
object "address space" as addr

object stack {
	user
	----
	kernel
	----
	...
}
```

### Multi threaded model
```
+------------------------------------------------+
|              +-- Thread 1 --+ +-- Thread 2 --+ |
| +---+        |     TCB      | |              | |
| |PCB|        |--------------| |              | |
| +---+        |  user stack  | |     ...      | |
|              |--------------| |              | |
| | addr |     | kernel stack | |              | |
| |space |     +--------------+ +--------------+ |                               
+------------------------------------------------+
                   |
                   V
  +- Thread1: Code Data Files --+
  |   regs  |   regs  |   regs  |
  |  stack  |  stack  |  stack  |
  |   ...   |   ...   |   ...   |
  +-----------------------------+
```
```plantuml
object PCB
object "address space" as addr

object Thread1 {
	TCB
	----
	user stack
	----
	kernel stack
	----
	...
}

object Thread2 {
	...
}

object "Code Data Files" as t1 {
	...
}

Thread1 -> t1
```


### Thread implementation
- Kernel level threads (as above)
	- OS is aware of threads
	- OS schedules next thread to run
	- slower thread switching because it requires context switching
- User level threads
	- OS is unaware of threads

### Threading issues
- if a thread calls `fork()`, depending on OS it may
	- clone all threads in the process
	- clone calling thread
- if a thread calls `exec()`, generally replaces the process
- process w/ threads calls `fork()`, to child threads clone?

## Multicore & Multithreading
- speed-up depends on the ability to exploit parallelism
- Amdahl's Law: speedup = (time to execute on single processor)/(time to execute on parallel processors)

$$
speedup = 1/((1-f)+f/N)
$$
where:
- f is the fraction we can speed up
- N is the number of processors

##### example:
- 10% code is serial (f=0.9)
- 8 processors

$$speedup = 1/(.1+.9/8)=4.7$$
